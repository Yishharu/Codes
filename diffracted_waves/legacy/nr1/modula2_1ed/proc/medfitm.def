     Fits y=a+bx by the criterion of least absolute deviations.
     The arrays X[0, ndata-1] and Y[0, ndata-1] are the input
     experimental points. The fitted parameters a and b are
     output, along with abdev which is the mean absolute deviation
     (in y) of the experimental points from the fitted line.
     This routine uses the routine rofunc, with communication
     via global variables.
