   (*
     Minimization of a function vFunc of n variables.
     Input consists of an initial starting point P[n]; an initial matrix XI[n, n]
     whose columns contain the initial set of directions (usually the n unit 
     vectors); and ftol, the fractional tolerance in the function value such that
     failure to decrease by more than this amount on one iteration signals 
     doneness.  On output, P is set to the best point found, XI is the 
     then-current direction set, fret is the returned function value at P, and
     iter is the number of iterations taken. The routine LinMin is used.

   PROCEDURE LinMin(P, XI: Vector; VAR fret: REAL; vFunc: VectorFunction); 
   (*
     Given an n dimensional point P[n] and an n dimensional direction XI[n], 
     moves and resets P to where the function func(P) takes on a minimum along
     the direction XI from P, and replaces XI by the actual vector displacement 
     that P was moved.  Also returns as fret the value of func at the returned 
     location P. This is actually all accomplished by calling the routines 
     MnBrak and Brent.
