     Incorporates into sum the jterm-th term, with value term,
     of an alternating series. sum is input as the previous partial
     sum, and is output as the new partial sum. The first call to this
     routine, with the first term in the series, should be with jterm=1.
     On the second call, term should be set to the second term
     of the series, with sign pposite to that of the first call, 
     and jterm should be 2.  And so on. Length of the WKSP vector must be 
     larger than any value of jterm to be used.
