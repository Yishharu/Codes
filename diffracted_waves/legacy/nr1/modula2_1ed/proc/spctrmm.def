     Reads data from the text file file (which has been reset in the
     calling program) and returns as P[J] the data's power (mean
     square amplitude) at frequency (J-1)/(2*m) cycles per gridpoint,
     for J=1,2,...,m, based on (2*K+1)*m data points (if ovrlap is set TRUE)
     or 4*K*m data points (if ovrlap is set FALSE). The number of segments 
     of the data is 2*K in both cases: the routine calls FOUR1 K-times, each 
     call with 2 partitions each of 2*m real data points.
