<h1>Numerical Recipes in Common Lisp</h1> <h3>(Ken Olum Variant)</h3>
</center>

The code in <a href="./">this directory</a>
is a slightly rewritten version of the Lisp Numerical Recipes code
translated by Kevin Broughan from the first edition of Numerical
Recipes in Fortran.  It is based on a slightly earlier version of the
Broughan code than that which appears <a href="../senac/readme.htm">elsewhere
on this CDROM</a>.  Because the needs of Lisp users vary widely,
it was felt that a slightly different customization of the original
Broughan files might be additionally useful to some users.<p>

The files in this directory are as follows:

<ul>

<li><a href="contents.txt">contents.txt</a> -- A list of which
routines are implemented and which file they are in.

<li><a href="header.l">header.l</a> -- A few utility functions that
are used in many different places in the code.

<li><a href="nr01.l">nr01.l</a> |
<a href="nr02.l">nr02.l</a> |
<a href="nr03.l">nr03.l</a> |
<a href="nr04.l">nr04.l</a> |
<a href="nr05.l">nr05.l</a> |
<a href="nr06.l">nr06.l</a> |
<a href="nr07.l">nr07.l</a> |
<a href="nr08.l">nr08.l</a> |
<a href="nr09.l">nr09.l</a> |
<a href="nr10.l">nr10.l</a> |

<a href="nr14.l">nr14.l</a> |
<a href="nr15.l">nr15.l</a> |
<a href="nr16.l">nr16.l</a> |
<a href="nr17.l">nr17.l</a> --
The Numerical Recipes code, organized by
chapters as in the first edition of Numerical Recipes in Fortran.

</ul>

I have made the following changes for use in Common Lisp
instead of the Senac system:<p>

<ul>
<li>Some utility functions are defined in the header file.
<li>Everything is in Common Lisp without implementation extensions or
dependencies.
<li>User-defined functions accept and return arrays, rather than
converting things to and from list structures.
</ul>

<b>Only some of the routines in this code have been tested.  Thus it is
quite possible that I have introduced bugs in my modifications of some
of the routines.</b>  If you suspect this you can compare these routines
with the ones in <a href="../senac/readme.htm">the Broughan/Senac
directory</a>.
The routines most likely to be affected are those in the FFT
chapter which deal with converting between real and complex arrays,
those that call user-supplied functions, and the function MEDFIT.<p>

The function MEDFIT does not work properly.  I believe the mistake was
in the original code before translation.  You might want to make a new
translation of the rewritten version of ROFUNC that appears in the
second edition of the books.<p>

Feel free to contact me at the email address below if you have
questions about this code, if you discover bugs, or if you would like
to make further improvements.<p>
