     Returns the integral of the function func over a three-dimensional 
     region specified by the limits x1, x2, and by the user-supplied functions 
     y1, y2, z1, and z2, as defined in (4.6.2). Integration is performed by 
     recursively calling a customized version of QGaus, here called QGaus3. 
     The parameter n in the routine labels the level of recursion. n=1 for the 
     x integration, n=2 for the y integration, while n=3 for the z integration.
