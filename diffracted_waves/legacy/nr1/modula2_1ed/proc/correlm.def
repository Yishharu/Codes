     Computes the correlation of two real data sets DATA1[0, n-1]
     and DATA2[0, n-1], each of length n (including any user-supplied
     zero padding).  n MUST be an integer power of two.  The answer
     is returned as the first n points in ANS[0, 2*n-1] stored in wraparound
     order, i.e.correlations at increasingly negative lags are in ANS[n-1]
     on down to ANS[n/2], while correlations at increasingly positive
     lags are in ANS[0] (zero lag) on up to ANS[n/2-1].  Note that
     ANS must be supplied in the calling program with length at least
     2*n, since it is also used as working space.  Sign convention of this
     routine: if DATA1 lags DATA2, i.e. is shifted to the right of it,
     then ANS will show a peak at positive lags.
