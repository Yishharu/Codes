
Numerical Recipes in Common Lisp
--------------------------------

The code in this directory is organized into files with each
file corresponding to a single chapter in Numerical Recipes
in Fortran, First Edition. The first chapter contains support
routines which may need to be loaded into Lisp before the 
Numerical Recipes Routines are called. If a function or functions
are to be compiled the macros in nr00.l must be loaded into
the compiler first. 

In the main, the subroutines have been translated into Lisp
defun's which may be called like any other Lisp function. A
number of subprogrammes have been translated to defvar's: these
are the ones where state is to be preserved between different
invocations. To call these use (funcall name arg1 arg2 ...) where
name is the symbol following the defvar (normally the name of
the corresponding Numerical Recipes routine).

These functions have been tested with a range of implementations
of Common Lisp. They have been incorporated into the symbolic-numeric
-graphic problem solving software system Senac. This has an easy
to use top level function for each Numerical Recipes function with
argument datatype checking. For details concerning Senac contact
