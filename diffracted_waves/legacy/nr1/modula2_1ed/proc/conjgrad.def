     Given a starting point P[n], Fletcher-Reeves-Polak-Ribiere minimization 
     is performed on a function fnc, using its gradient as calculated by a 
     routine dfnc. The convergence tolerance on the function value is input 
     as frol. Returned quantities are P (the location of the minimum), iter
     (the number of iterations that were performed), and fret (the minimum 
     value of the function).  The routine LinMin is called to perform line 
     minimizations.
