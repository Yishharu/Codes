   PROCEDURE FixRts(D: Vector); 
   (*
     Given the LP coefficients D[0, NPOLES-1], this routine
     finds all roots of the characteristic polynomial (12.10.3), reflects
     any roots that are outside the unit circle back inside, and then
     returns a modified set of D's.  The routine Zroots of section 9.5 is 
     referenced.

   PROCEDURE Predic(DATA, D, FUTURE: Vector); 
   (*
     Given DATA[0, NDATA-1], and given the data's LP coefficients 
     D[0, NPOLES-1], this routine applies equation (12.10.1) to predict the 
     next NFUT data points, which it returns in the array FUTURE[0, NFUT-1].  
     Note that the routine references only the last NPOLES values of DATA, as
     initial values for the prediction.
