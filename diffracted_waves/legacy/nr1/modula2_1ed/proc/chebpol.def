   PROCEDURE ChebPC(C, D: Vector); 
   (*
     Chebyshev polynomial coefficients.  Given a coefficient array 
     C[0, n-1], this routine generates a coefficient array D[0, n-1] 
     such that (sum(k=0)to(n-1)) Dky^(k) = (sum(k=0)to(n-1)) CkTk(y).  
     The method is Clenshaw's recurrence (5.6.11), but
     now applied algebraically rather than arithmetically.

   PROCEDURE PCShft(a, b: REAL; 
                    D:    Vector); 
   (*
     Polynomial coefficient shift.  Given a coefficient array D[0, n-1],
     this routine generates a coefficient array g such
     that (sum(k=0)to(n-1)) Dky^k = (sum(k=0)to(n-1)) gkx^k,
     where x and y are related by (5.6.10), i.e. the interval -1 < y < 1
     is mapped to the interval a < x < b. The array g is returned
     in D.
