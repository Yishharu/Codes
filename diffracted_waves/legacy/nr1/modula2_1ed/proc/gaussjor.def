   (*
     Linear equation solution by Gauss-Jordan elimination,
     equation (2.1.1) above.  The input matrix a[n, n] has n
     by n elements. b[n, m] is an input matrix of size
     n by m containing the m right-hand side vectors. On output, 
     a is replaced by its matrix inverse, and b is replaced by the 
     corresponding set of solution vectors.
