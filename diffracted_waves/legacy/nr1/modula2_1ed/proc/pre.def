     In this routine JulDay returns the Julian Day Number which begins at 
     noon of the calendar date specified by month mm, day id, and  year 
     iyyy, all integer variables.  Positive year signifies A.D.; negative, B.C.  
     Remember that the year after 1 B.C. was 1 A.D. Note that this routine 
     will not run on systems with 2-byte integers. The type LongInt (4-byte 
     integer) is discussed further in section 1.2.

   PROCEDURE BadLuk; 
   (*
     Uses the procedures FlMoon and JulDay. Note that this routine will 
     not run on systems with 2-byte integers. The type LongInt (4-byte integer) 
     is discussed further in section 1.2.

   (*
     Inverse of the function JulDay given above. Here julian is input as a 
     Julian Day Number, and the routine outputs mm,id, nd iyyy as the month,
     day, and year on which the specified Julian Day started at noon.
     Note that this routine will not run on systems with 2-byte integers.
