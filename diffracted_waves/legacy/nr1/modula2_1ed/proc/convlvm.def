   (*
     Convolves or deconvolves a real data set DATA[0, n-1] (including any
     user-supplied zero padding) with a response function RESPNS[0, n-1].
     The response function must be stored in wrap around order in the first
     m elements of RESPNS, where m is an odd integer <= n. 
     Wrap around order means that the first half of the array RESPNS contains the
     impulse response function at positive times, while the second half of the
     array contains the impulse response function at negative times, counting
     down from the highest element RESPNS[m].
     On input isign is +1 for convolution, -1 for deconvolution.
     The answer is returned in the first n components of ANS.  
     However, ANS must be supplied in the calling program with dimensions 
     [0, 2*n-1], for consistency with TWOFFT. n MUST be an integer power of two.
