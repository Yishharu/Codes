     Given two arrays X[0, n-1] and Y[0, n-1], this routine computes their 
     correlation coefficient r (returned as r), the significance level at 
     which the null hypothesis of zero correlation is disproved (prob whose 
     small value indicates a significant correlation), and Fisher's z 
     (returned as z), whose value can be used in further statistical tests as
     described above.
