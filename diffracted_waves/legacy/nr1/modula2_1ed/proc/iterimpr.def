     Improves a solution vector x[0, n-1] of the linear set of equations 
     A x = b.  The matrix A[n, n], and the vectors B[n] and X are input.  
     Also input is ALUD[n, n], the LU decomposition of a as returned by LUDCMP, 
     and the vector INDX[0, n-1] also returned by that routine.  On output, 
     only x is modified, to an improved set of values.
