     Fifth-order Runge-Kutta step with monitoring of local
     truncation error to ensure accuracy and adjust stepsize.
     Input are the dependent variable vector Y[0, n-1]
     and its derivative DYDX[0, n-1] at the starting
     value of the independent variable x.  Also input
     are the stepsize to be attempted htry, the required accuracy eps,
     and the vector YSCAL[0, n-1] against which the error is scaled.  On
     output, Y and x are replaced by their new values, hdid
     is the stepsize which was actually accomplished, and hnext is
     the estimated next stepsize.  derivs is a user-supplied routine
     that computes the right-hand side derivatives.

     Runge-Kutta driver with adaptive stepsize control.
     Integrate from x1 to x2 with accuracy eps, using 
     starting values YSTART[0, n-1] and storing intermediate results in global
     variables.  h1 should be set as a guessed first
     stepsize, hmin as the minimum allowed stepsize (can be zero).
     On output nok and nbad are the number of good and bad (but retried
     and fixed) steps taken, and YSTART is replaced by values at the
     end of the integration interval.
     derivs is the user-supplied routine for calculating the right-hand 
     side derivative, while RKQC is the name of the stepper routine to be used.
