   (*
     Improve the trial solution of a two point boundary value problem
     for n coupled ODEs shooting from x1 to x2. Initial values for the n 
     ODEs at x1 are generated from the coefficients V[0, n2-1], using the 
     user-supplied routine load. The routine integrates the ODEs to x2
     using the Runge-Kutta method with tolerance eps, initial step size 
     h1, and minimum step size hmin. At x2 it calls the user-supplied routine 
     score to evaluate the functions F[0, n2-1] that ought to be zero to 
     satisfy the boundary conditions at x2. Multi-dimensional Newton-Raphson 
     is then used to develop a linear matrix equation for the increments 
     DV[0, n2-1] to the adjustable parameters V. These increments are solved 
     for and added before return. The user-supplied routine derivs(x, y, DYDX) 
     supplies derivative information to the ODE integrator (see Chapter 15).
