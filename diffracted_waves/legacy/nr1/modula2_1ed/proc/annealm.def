     This algorithm finds the shortest round-trip path to NCITY
     cities whose coordinates are in the arrays X[NCITY],Y[NCITY].  The
     array IORDER[NCITY] specifies the order in which the cities are visited.
     On input, the elements of IORDER may be set to any permutation
     of the numbers 1 to NCITY.  This routine will return the best 
     alternative path it can find.
