   (*
     Given a starting point P[n], the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno variant
     of Davidon-Fletcher-Powell minimization is performed on a function
     fnc, using its gradient as calculated by a routine dfnc.
     The convergence requirement on the function value is input as ftol.
     Returned quantities are P (the location of the minimum), iter (the number 
     of iterations that were performed), and fret (the minimum value of the 
     function). The routine LinMin is called to perform line minimizations.
