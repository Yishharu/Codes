     Given values for n variables Y[0, n-1] and their derivatives DYDX[0, n-1]
     known at x, use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to advance the 
     solution over an interval h and return the incremented variables as 
     YOUT[0, n-1], which need not be a distinct array from Y. The user supplies 
     the routine derivs(x,y,DYDX) which returns 
     derivatives DYDX at x.
