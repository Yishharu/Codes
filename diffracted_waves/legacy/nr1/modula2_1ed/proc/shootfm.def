   (*
     Improve the trial solution of a two point boundary value problem
     for n coupled ODEs shooting from x1 and x2 to a fitting point xf. 
     Initial values for the n ODEs at x1 (x2) are generated from the
     coefficients V1[n2] (V2[n1]), using the user-supplied routine
     load1(load2). The routine integrates the ODEs to xf using the 
     Runge-Kutta method with tolerance eps, initial stepsize h1, and minimum 
     stepsize hmin. At xf it calls the user-supplied routine score to evaluate 
     the functions F[n] that ought to match at xf.
     Multi-dimensional Newton-Raphson is then used to develop a linear matrix 
     equation for the increments DV1[n2] (DV2[n1]) to the adjustable 
     parameters V1 (V2). These increments are solved for and added before return. 
     The user-supplied routine derivs(x, y, DYDX) supplies derivative information 
     to the ODE integrator (see Chapter 15).
