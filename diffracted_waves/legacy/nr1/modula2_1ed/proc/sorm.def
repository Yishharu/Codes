   PROCEDURE SOR(A, B, C, D, E, F, U: LMatrix; rjac: LongReal); 
   (*
     SOR solution of equation (17.5.25) with Chebyshev acceleration.
     A, B, C, DD, E and F are input as the coefficients of the equation, 
     each dimensioned to the grid size [jmax, jmax]. U is input as the 
     initial guess to the solution, usually zero, and returns with the 
     final value. rjac is input as the spectral radius of the Jacobi 
     iteration, or an estimate of it.
