   (*
     Modified midpoint step.  At xs, input the dependent variable vector
     Y[0, n-1] and its derivative vector DYDX[0, n-1]. Also input is htot, 
     the total step to be made, and nstep, the number of substeps to be used.
     The output is returned as YOUT[0, n-1], which need not be a distinct 
     array from Y; if it is distinct, however, then Y and DYDX are returned
     undamaged. derivs is the user-supplied routine for calculating the
     right-hand side derivative.
