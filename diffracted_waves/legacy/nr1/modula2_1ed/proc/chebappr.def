     Chebyshev fit: Given a function func, lower and upper
     limits of the interval [a, b], and a maximum degree n, this
     routine computes the n coefficients C[0, n-1] such that
     func(x) is approximately equal to [(sum(k=1)to(n)) CkT(k-1)(y)] - c1/2,
     where y and x are related by (5.6.10). This routine
     is to be used with moderately large n (e.g. 30 or 50), the array of
     C's subsequently to be truncated at the smaller value m such
     that Cm+1 and subsequent elements are negligible.

     Chebyshev evaluation: All arguments are input. 
     C[0, n-1] is an array whose first m elements contain Chebyshev
     coefficients produced by ChebFt (which must have been called with 
     the same a and b).
     The Chebyshev polynomial is evaluated at a point y determined from 
     x, a, and b, and the result is returned as the function value.
