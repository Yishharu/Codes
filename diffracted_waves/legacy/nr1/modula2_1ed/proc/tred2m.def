   PROCEDURE TRED2(A: Matrix; DD, E: Vector); 
   (*
     Householder reduction of a real, symmetric, matrix A[n, n].  On output,
     A is replaced by the orthogonal matrix Q effecting the transformation.  
     D[n] returns the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix, and E[n] 
     the off-diagonal elements, with E[0]=0.  Several statements, as noted in 
     comments, can be omitted if only eigenvalues are to be found, in which case 
     A contains no useful information on output. Otherwise they are to be 
     included.
