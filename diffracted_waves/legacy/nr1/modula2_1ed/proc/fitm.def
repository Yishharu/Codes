     Fit a straight line y=a+bx to a given set of points 
     X[0, ndata-1], Y[0, ndata-1], with standard deviations
     SIG[0, ndata], by minimizing  "chi"^2.
     Returned are a, b and their respective probable uncertainties siga and
     sigb, the chi-square chi2, and the goodness-of-fit probability q
     (that the fit would have "chi"^2 this large or larger). If mwt=0 on 
     input, then the standard deviations are assumed to be unavailable: q is 
     returned as 1.0 and the normalization of chi2 is to unit 
     standard deviation on all points.
