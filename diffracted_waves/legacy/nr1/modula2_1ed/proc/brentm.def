     Given a function func, and given a bracketing triplet of
     abscissas ax, bx, cx (such that bx is between ax and cx, and func(bx) 
     is less than both func(ax) and func(cx)), this routine isolates the 
     minimum to a fractional precision of about tol using Brent's method.  
     The abscissa of the minimum is returned as xmin, and the minimum function
     value is returned as the returned function value.

END BrentM.
