   (*
     ADI solution of equations (17.6.12) and (17.6.13), with the
     operators as defined in equation (17.6.22).
     On input, A, B, C, DD, E and F contain the coefficients of the equation.
     G contains the right-hand side, while U is input as the initial
     guess, usually zero. All these arrays are dimensioned to the grid size,
     [jMax, jMax]. The routine carries out 2 to the power k iterations
     with different values of r, and then repeats. alpha and
     beta are user-supplied bounds for the eigenvalues of Lx
     and Ly, while eps is the desired reduction in the norm
     of the residual. Note that the routine as given requires a double
     precision version of Tridag from section 2.6.
