   (*
     Driver routine for solution of two point boundary value problems 
     by relaxation. itmax is the maximum number of iterations. conv is 
     the convergence criterion (see text). slowc controls the fraction 
     of corrections actually used after each iteration. SCALV[ne] contains
     typical sizes for each dependent variable, used to weight errors. 
     INDEXV[ne] lists the column ordering of variables used to construct 
     the matrix S[ne, 2*ne+1] of derivatives. (The nb boundary conditions at 
     the first mesh point must contain some dependence on the first nb 
     variables listed in INDEXV.) The problem involves ne equations 
     for ne adjustable dependent variables at each point. At the first mesh 
     point there are nb boundary conditions. There are a total of m mesh points.
     Y[ne, m] is the two-dimensional array that contains the initial guess for 
     all the dependent variables at each mesh point. On each iteration, it 
     is updated by the calculated correction. The arrays C[0..ne][0..ne-nb][0..m]
     and S supply dummy storage used by the relaxation code.
