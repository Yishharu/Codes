     Given the array BINS[nbins], containing the observed numbers of events, 
     and an array EBINS[nbins] containing the expected numbers of events, and
     given the number of constraints knstrn (normally zero), this routine 
     returns (trivially) the number of degrees of freedom df, and (nontrivially)
     the chi-square chsq and the significance prob. a small value of prob 
     indicates a significant difference between the distributions BINS and
     EBINS. Note that BINS and EBINS are both real arrays, although BINS will 
     normally contain integer values.

     Given the arrays BINS1[nbins] and BINS2[nbins], containing two sets of 
     binned data, and given the number of additional constraints knstrn

     Given an array DATA[n], and given a user-supplied function of a single 
     variable func which is a cumulative distribution function ranging from 0 
     (for smallest values of its argument) to 1 (for largest values of its 
     argument), this routine returns the K--s statistic d, and the significance
     level prob.  Small values of prob show that the cumulative distribution
     function of DATA is significantly different from func. The array DATA is
     modified by being sorted into ascending order.

     Given an array DATA1[n1] and an array DATA2[n2], this routine returns the 
     KS statistic d, and the significance level prob for the null hypothesis 
     that the data sets are drawn from the same distribution. Small values of 
     prob show that the cumulative distribution function of DATA1 is 
     significantly different from that of DATA2. The arrays DATA1 and DATA2 are
     modified by being sorted into ascending order.
