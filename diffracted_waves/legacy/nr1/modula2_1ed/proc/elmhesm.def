     Reduction to Hessenberg form by the elimination method.
     The real, nonsymmetric matrix A[n, n] is replaced by an
     upper Hessenberg matrix with identical eigenvalues.  Recommended, but
     not required, is that this routine be preceded by Balanc.
     On output, the Hessenberg matrix is in elements a[i,j] with
     i<=j+1.  Elements with i>j+1 are to be thought
     of as zero, but are returned with random values.
