     Using bisection, find the root of a function fx
     known to lie between x1 and x2. The root, returned
     as RtBis, will be refined until its accuracy is (+-)xacc.

   (*
     Given a function fx and an initial guessed range
     x1 to x2, the routine expands the range geometrically until
     a root is bracketed by the returned values x1 and x2 (in
     which case success returns as TRUE) or until the range
     becomes unacceptably large (in which case success returns as FALSE).
     Success is guaranteed for a function which has opposite
     signs for sufficiently large and small arguments.

     Given a function fx defined on the interval from x1 to x2
     subdivide the interval into n equally spaced segments, and search for
     zero crossings of the function.

     to the number of bracketing pairs XB1[1, nb], XB2[1, nb] that are found.
