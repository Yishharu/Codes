     Given a,b,C, as output from routine ChebFt
     section 5.6, the desired degree of approximation
     (i.e., elements C[0, n-1] are to be used),
     this routine returns the array CINT[0, n-1], the Chebyshev
     coefficients of the integral of the function whose coefficients are C.
     The constant of integration is set so that the integral vanishes at a.
